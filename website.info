This website is built off of Springboot-MVC using Thymeleaf in java. Using Thymeleaf, I am able to automatically inject values into the HTML code with Java as they are being served out to the user. This lets me call APIs for the project page to connect to my git stash server and dynamically update the project list. 
Libraries: JavaX, Jackson, Commons IO,  Microsoft SQL, Spring Boot JDA, Spring Boot Auto-Configure, Spring Boot Mail, Spring Boot Web, and Spring Boot Thymeleaf
